* Basic feedback delay.
* Audio level delay. Just one slightly delayed head playing and feeding back.
  Perhaps on specific tones.

  Producing reverb. Add flutter to make it forever moving and changing.
* Basic tremolo, just cyclic flutter.
* Percussion rhythm.
* Delays comming back, with some heads close, some far to repeat way later.
* When bass drum and single oscillator tone play at the same time with high
  saturation and low bias, it works like sidechaining.
* Short cybmals, low bias cuts weak signal.
* Ping pong snare. Like Daughter's New Ways.
