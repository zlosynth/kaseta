## Patches

* Basic hysteresis.
* Basic flutter with disabled hysteresis.
* Basic evenly spread one time delay.
* Basic feedback delay.
* Audio level delay. Just one slightly delayed head playing and feeding back.
  Perhaps on specific tones.
* Plain sine. All four heads playing in a small distance from each other.
  Producing reverb. Add flutter to make it forever moving and changing.
* Basic tremolo, just cyclic flutter.
* Custom wow/flutter using position modulation.
* Percussion rhythm.
* Delays comming back, with some heads close, some far to repeat way later.
* When bass drum and single oscillator tone play at the same time with high
  saturation and low bias, it works like sidechaining.
* Short cybmals, low bias cuts weak signal.
* Ping pong snare. Like Daughter's New Ways.
* Warm soft saturation on piano is nice.
* With non-warping delay, CV S&H input to delay value, selecting samples from
  the past.
