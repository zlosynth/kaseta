\section{Overview}

You can always find the latest version of this build manual on
\url{https://zlosynth.com/kaseta-build-manual.pdf}.

This kit contains a printed circuit board (PCB) with all the surface mount
device (SMD) parts already pre-soldered. The through-hole components are left to
be assembled by you.

Pay attention to the orientation and position of all the parts. Desoldering them
would be difficult and may break the module. Also, be careful not to touch the
pre-soldered SMD parts with the soldering iron. Read through the whole manual
first. Make sure you understand all the steps before you start soldering.

\section{Tools required}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Soldering iron
  \item Masking tape
  \item Flat head screwdriver
  \item Phillips head screwdriver
  \item Side-cutters
\end{itemize}

\end{tabular}

\section{Power and I2C}

Start by soldering the power and I2C connectors.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Take the male 2\texttimes5 connector and put the side with shorter legs
    through the footprint marked as ``Power''. Make sure to put it on the
    correct side of the PCB.
  \item Solder a single pin in and check that the connector is upright. If it
    is not, heat up the pin and align the connector by pushing it against the
    board.
  \item Solder all the pins in.
\end{enumerate}

Repeat the process for the male 1\texttimes3 connector, placed in the ``I2C''
footprint.

\section{Daisy Patch Submodule}

The Daisy Patch Submodule is connected to the main PCB through a set of
connectors.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Mount the four female 2\texttimes5 connectors on the pins of the Daisy
    Patch Submodule. See figure \ref{daisy}. This makes it easier to
    align all the connectors properly.
  \item Plug the connectors of the submodule into the black PCB through
    footprints marked as ``SM''. Make sure to put them on the correct side
    of the PCB, where all four connectors are marked.
  \item Solder all the pins in.
  \item Once done, carefully detach Daisy Patch Submodule to prevent it
    from getting damaged while progressing with the build. It may be a
    little difficult. Pull each connector by a millimeter at a time.
    The result is illustrated in figure \ref{connectors}.

\section{Front panel}

Now when all the internal parts are soldered, the next step would be to assemble
parts sitting in the front panel.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Put the hex standoff on top of the hole labeled ``Standoff'' and secure
    it there with the phillips screw.
  \item Snap in the button. Take care not to bend its leg. Don't push it all the
    way to the PCB. See figure \ref{front components}.
  \item Place the 5 green D-shaped potentiometers in ``Green pot''
    footprints, do not solder them yet. The big legs on the sides are used to
    snap the pot in. Use the appropriate pot for the bottom-most place
    marked as ``Green pot w/ center detent''.
  \item Similarly, place the 14 blue trimmer potentiometers in the ``Blue pot''
    footprints, some of which are marked for center detent.
  \item Place sliding potentiometers in their marked places. Do not put their
    caps on yet.
  \item Put all jack sockets into the PCB.
  \item Put LEDs in place. Pay attention to the markings on the PCB explaining
    their correct orientation.
  \item Now when all parts are in, carefully put the front panel on them.
    Be patient aligning all parts so they fit through holes. The button may be a
    little problematic. If you see it not getting through, use tweezers to align
    its bottom part. Don't worry about the LEDs for now.
  \item Put washers on the pots and jacks. See figure \ref{washers}. Pot washers
    fit tightly into the panel, don't be afraid to push them in if needed.
  \item Secure the front side of the standoff with the flat-head screw.
    Tighten the WOW/FLUT potentiometer with a nut.
  \item Go over all the trimmer pots and check that they turn smoothly. If they
    don't, the may not be aligned with the panel correctly. There are two
    options to fix this. If many of them are stiff, loosen the standoff screw
    and WOW/FLUT nut, and try to shift the front panel into a better position.
    If the issue is limited to fewer trimmer potentiometers, try using tweezers
    to bend legs of given pot to align it straight against the panel.
  \item Double-check that WOW/FLUT, TONE, and all the PAN pots have a center
    detent (they snap in the middle).
  \item Finally tighten all the potentiometers and jack sockets in place with
    their nuts. Use care not to scratch the panel. Plastic tools are prefered,
    and steel drivers should also serve well. If you only have pliers, put them
    in a thick plastic bag. Protect the panel!

\clearpage

Once all the components are placed correctly, with potentiometers moving freely
and the button returning after being pressed, move on to soldering.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Solder in all the potentiometers and jacks. Only solder the three
    smaller terminals of each potentiometer.
  \item For each sliding potentiometer, move its shaft to the center, press on
    it so it sits flat on the PCB and solder one of the smaller terminals. Try
    moving the shaft from one end to another making sure that it is aligned with
    the hole. If it is not, heat up the terminal and try aligning the
    potentiometer.
  \item Once the sliding potentiometers is in a satisifying position, solder the
    other two of its smaller terminals.
  \item Use a masking tape on the portion of the panel with holes for LEDs, see
    figure \ref{masking}. Push the LEDs against the tape, even with the panel
    surface.
  \item Solder the LEDs. Then snap their legs off and remove the tape.
  \item Use tweezers to align the button. About 2 mm of it should be
    sticking out of the panel. Test that it can be easily clicked and
    returns to its resting position. If it does not, try to angle its body.
  \item Once the button is in a satisfying position, solder one of its legs,
    double-check it can be clicked and that it returns, and solder the remaining
    legs.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Knobs and caps}

You can now put knobs and caps on the potentiometers.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Put black knobs on the five pots on the left. Align them with the
    D-shaped shaft and press them in. You may need to pull them a little bit if
    you see they are scratching the nut.
  \item Mount the black caps onto the shafts of slider potentiometers.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Final assembly}

Connect the Daisy Patch Submodule to the main black PCB to complete the build.
